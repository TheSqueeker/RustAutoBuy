# RustAutoBuy (SPEED)
Rust Auto Buy is a script for Rust *the game* to automate the buy/sell of items!
SPEED branch for faster sell times with the down side of looking more like a bot.

Please note that TheSqueeker and RustAutoBuy have no affiliations with Facepunch Studios Ltd or Rust

## Get started!
Make sure you have Python3 installed

To start you have to install the Keyboard and Mouse libraries!
To install use ```pip install keyboard``` & ```pip install mouse```

### How it works:
1. Make sure RustAutoBuy is in a easy to use place.
2. Open Rust and get ready to buy/sell at a vending machine.
3. Start the script by double clicking the RustAutoBuy.py
4. Once started it will ask if you are going to Outpost if so type "Yes" if not press enter.
5. The it will prompt you to hover the mouse over the Buy button (you have 5 seconds to do so).
6. It will say "Captured" then you have 2 seconds to hover over the amount (below the buy button).
7. Once it prints "Captured" again you have 5 seconds to start a movie or somthing and click back into Rust.
8. It will start auto buy/sell at the max! When done press and HOLD 'F'
